# most recent update
## April 29th, 2025
My goodness it's been a while! Sorry about that everyone, lotta stuff came up recently and it's taken quite the toll on me, but I'm figuring things out and working with it.
Little update, on the [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Despatra/Phoxel/projects?query=is%3Aopen) for Phoxel I've changed some things and added progress bars for you all so you can see better how things are coming along!
I'm happy to say that the first pre-release isn't far from done! So keep your eyes out for the next weekish, as I should be able to get it finally to you all within that time!
